# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Desgin

DriverPass was a client looking to create a website to teach and enable students to pass their driving test. DriverPass needed a system that could support learning modules, bundle purchasing, and appointment scheduling among other things.

Throughout the course I created multiple UML diagrams to better show the client exactly how the system would preform and I believe that is the highlight of my work. 

There is always room for improvement and I would definitely focus on the finer details in my diagrams themselves to fix.

Users needs is incredibly important to the system design, if the client is requesting a specific function to exist in the system then we have to try to put that function in. Going over the desired componets and reviewing how they will be implemented allows good communication and a clear vision on what the client wants.

Designing software is a lot of planning and organizing which is an amazing skill to have. Moving forward I will be taking those organizational skills into future work with me.
